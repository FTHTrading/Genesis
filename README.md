# Genesis Protocol

Deterministic evolutionary economics engine. 13 crates. 339 tests. Pure Rust.

Digital organisms are born with cryptographic genomes, metabolize scarce resources, mutate under selective pressure, and die when they can't pay their entropy cost. Institutional mechanisms — treasury, taxation, catastrophe events, adaptive regulation — emerge as endogenous feedback loops, not exogenous parameters. Every state transition is deterministically replayable and cryptographically verifiable.

This is not a simulation wrapper. It is a research platform for conducting reproducible macroeconomic experiments on populations of autonomous agents operating under real scarcity constraints.

## What Has Been Proven

Three flagship experiments. 500 independent world simulations. 250,000 total economic epochs. Zero civilization collapses.

| Experiment | Worlds | Epochs | Key Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Entropy Sweep** | 200 | 100,000 | 10× increase in metabolic cost produces only 4.9% Gini increase. No collapses. |
| **Catastrophe Resilience** | 140 | 70,000 | 0–3% catastrophe probability per epoch → zero collapses. Deaths scale linearly (0 → 12.4). Population declines only 4.6%. |
| **Inequality Threshold** | 160 | 80,000 | Varying wealth tax threshold from 0.20 to 0.90 produces 31.6% Gini increase. Population stability and mean fitness remain invariant. |

All results are deterministically reproducible from seed `20260222`, verified via SHA-256 result hashing, and exported as CSV datasets for independent analysis.

## Architecture

Thirteen crates. One organism.

| Layer | Crate | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | `genesis-dna` | Cryptographic genome, trait expression, phenotype derivation |
| **Economics** | `metabolism` | ATP energy ledger, treasury, metabolic decay |
| **Econometrics** | `genesis-econometrics` | Gini coefficient, wealth distribution analysis |
| **Evolution** | `evolution` | Mutation, natural selection, horizontal gene transfer |
| **Population** | `ecosystem` | Social mesh, problem markets, carrying capacity, telemetry |
| **Regulation** | `genesis-homeostasis` | Adaptive Cortex — real-time parameter modulation from population signals |
| **Multiverse** | `genesis-multiverse` | Parallel world instantiation, parameter sweep, cross-world aggregation |
| **Experiments** | `genesis-experiment` | Experiment engine, trial runner, statistical reporting |
| **Cryptography** | `genesis-anchor` | Dual-chain anchoring — SHA-256 state chain + BLAKE3 genome chain |
| **Replay** | `genesis-replay` | Deterministic replay from any checkpoint |
| **Federation** | `genesis-federation` | Cross-instance communication protocol |
| **Gateway** | `gateway` | HTTP API, SSE event stream, observatory dashboard |
| **Recruitment** | `apostle` | Outbound integration and agent recruitment |

### Dual-Chain Cryptographic Architecture

Every tick, two independent hash chains advance:

- **State Chain** (SHA-256): `H(previous_state_hash ‖ epoch ‖ population_snapshot)` — anchors macroeconomic state
- **Genome Chain** (BLAKE3): `H(previous_genome_hash ‖ mutated_genomes)` — anchors evolutionary lineage

Divergence between chains is detectable. Replay integrity is verifiable to any depth.

## Reproduce an Experiment

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/FTHTrading/AI.git
cd AI
cargo build --release

# Run all three flagship experiments (~24 seconds)
cargo run --release --bin run_experiments

# Results appear in experiments/
#   entropy_sweep/          — 200 worlds, data + manifest + report
#   catastrophe_resilience/ — 140 worlds, data + manifest + report
#   inequality_threshold/   — 160 worlds, data + manifest + report

# Verify the full test suite
cargo test --workspace
# Expected: 339 passed, 0 failed
```

Each experiment exports:
- **CSV data** — per-trial metrics for independent analysis
- **JSON manifest** — parameters, seed, SHA-256 result hash
- **Text report** — human-readable statistical summary
